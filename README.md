**Smart Insights** is a comprehensive, no-code data analytics and machine learning web application. It allows users to upload raw datasets and instantly receive interactive dashboards, predictive forecasts, plain-English explanations, and professional executive reports.

## ✨ Key Features

* **📊 Dynamic Dashboard:** Instantly visualizes KPIs, time-series trends, and categorical distributions upon data upload. Includes an interactive Q&A section to query your data.
* **🧠 Automated AI Insights:** Automatically detects statistical anomalies (via Isolation Forest), missing values, highly correlated metrics, and skewed distributions.
* **📈 Advanced Analysis:** Deep-dive tools including an interactive data explorer with multi-level filtering, correlation heatmaps, and hierarchical segment analysis (treemaps & pie charts).
* **🏢 Sector Analysis:** Domain-specific templates (Healthcare, Retail, Finance, etc.) to benchmark top/bottom performers, generate multi-metric radar charts, and conduct head-to-head segment comparisons.
* **🔮 ML Forecasting Engine:** * *Time-Series Forecasting:* Predict future trends using Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, or Linear Regression.
  * *Regression Predictor:* Train custom models to predict target variables based on selected features, complete with feature importance and accuracy metrics (R², MAE, RMSE).
* **💬 NLP Insights Center:** Translates complex data visualizations (scatter plots, distributions, forecasting bands) into easy-to-understand, plain-English narratives.
* **📑 Intelligence Report Engine:** One-click generation of a self-contained, downloadable HTML executive report containing data quality audits, trend analysis, risk flags, and strategic recommendations.
